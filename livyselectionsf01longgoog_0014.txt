10 TITUS LIVIUS

surroundings Livy no doubt acquired a habit of mind
which in part explains his antiquarian tendencies and
his primitive saith. It is recorded that C. Asinius
Pollio, a prominent contemporary, 'thought Livy guilty
of PatavinitaS, but it is more likely that this to us indefi-
nite criticism was applied to some peculiarity in his
diction, than ·to the bent of his mind. The citizens of
Patavium were granted Roman citizenship in 49 Β. 0.,
when Livy was at the impressionable age of ten. In
the same year Caesar crossed the Rubicon. Whether
from these events he became a sympathizer 'with Pom-
pey, as Augustus later playfully charged him with being,
is uncertain, but it is evident from the general Preface
that the civil wars distressed him, and throughout he ·
is, as a laudator temporis acti, a republican in feeling
and expression.

How long Livy remained at Patavium before finally
taking up residence in Rome is a matter of conjecture.
He was in Rome at any rate shortly after the battle
of Actium, 31 Β. c.,.and it is known that the first book
of his history was written there before 25 Β. c. He
⁵ seems to have won speedy recognition of his merits
and was a familiar in the distinguished coterie of literary
men whom Augustus honorably encouraged. There is
no record that Livy was a man of affairS, and appar-
ently most of his life was devoted to his great literary
work. So great was his renown‚ even in his own day,
that according to the well' known story a Spaniard
came all the way to Rome that he might but catch a
glimpse of him, and after accomplishing this he at once ·
returned home—a story which moved Petrarch to
exclaim that he would have come from India to see
so great a man.

Of Livy's immediate family, two children, a son and
a daughter, are mentioned. Of these we merely know
