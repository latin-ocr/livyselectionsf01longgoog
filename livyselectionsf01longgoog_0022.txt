18 TITUS LIVIUS

least has the merit of not trying to make a thinly dis-
guised personal opinion pass for authentic history
(1. 24. -1; 46. 43 6. 42. 6). His very citation of varia-

events that followed in the evolution of the state, the

’· perfect prose style. In it, especially in the earlier bookS,
poetry is not wholly divorced from prose, and withal
there is such a sympathetic treatment of every theme,
such a elever adaptation of language to suit every situa-
tion, that it is small wonder that as a stylist he has
aroused the greatest admiration in every age. To
