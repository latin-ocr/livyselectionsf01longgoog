XXI-XXX, the second Punic war.
XXXI-XL, the Macedonian wars. ’
XLI-LXX, to the outbreak of the Social wars.
LXXI-LXXX, to the death of Marius.
LXXXI-XC,- to the death of Sulla.
XCI-CVIII, war with Sertorius ; Caesar’s Gallic

CIX-CXVI, Civil wars to the death of Caesar.
CXVII-CXXXIII, to the conquest of Antony
and Cleopatra.
CXXXIV-CXLII, to the death of DruSUS, 9 Β.0.
