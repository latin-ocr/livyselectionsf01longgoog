INTRODUCTION 19

Quintilian he was a writer of wonderful eloquence, mirae
facundiae (8. 1. 3), whom he further characterizes as
follows: cum in ‘narrando mirae iucunditatis clarissimique
candoris tum in contionibus supra quam enarrari potest
eloquentem; ita quae dicuutur omnia cum rebus tum personis
accommodata sunt (10. l. 101); to Seneca he was dissertis-
simus (de‘ Ira 1. 20. 6) ; to Tacitus he was eloouentissi-
mus (Agric. 10), and eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in
primis (Ann. 4. 34).

The eloquence of his style is secured by smooth, flow-
ing periods which show striking skill in the effectiveness
of their word order. There is no monotony of lengthy
sentence, for Livy's vivid imagination soon quickens
every situation into lively action which the reader seems
actually to see. Not the least important means for
this effect is seen in the finished speeches interspersed
in the work. These and the personal incidents so
graphically told give to the work noW, as they did in
ancient timeS, one of its greatest charms, the element*
of human interest. ‘

Livy's diction represents the tendency of his age to
vary from the more strict norms of Ciceronian prose.
. Poetic expressions are more frequent, rhetoric is some-
.what more in evidence, and many new usageS, or bold
advances in older usage, are found. In syntax the
following characteristicS, as seen in the selections of
this edition, may be noted: ’

is freely used: operae, Praef. 1; tutelae, 1. 6. 4 3 pote-statie,
7. 31. 6. b. The dative (1) of reference is very much
extended and is often practically the equivalent of a
poss. gen.: -raptiS, 1. 9. 143 10. 1; flectenti, 1. 48. 6;
SamnitibuS, 7. 33. 6. (2) of purpose, or final dative,
is very· frequent: crimini dabant, l. 5. 4 ; praedae, 3. 29. 2 ;
cordi, 9. 1. 4.· With esse it is often=a passive voice:
