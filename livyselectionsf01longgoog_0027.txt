I n this yeneral Preface Isivy
sets forth his object from a patri-
otic and from a personal nt of
view in writiny a yenera histem
(si a primordio . perscrip-
serim) of Rome. No state was
ever yreater, none richer in the
illustriores deeds of its mem yreed
and corruption entered it late.
The writer, turniny for the time
from the evils of his own day,
will first treat, carefree, the poetic
leyends and memorable deeds os
those earlier a9e8. For the
reader, there will be that whole-
some and profitable result that
comes from all θινός] of history-‘—

after nec satis scio. Livy modestly
does not know whether the results
will be commensurate with his effort.
Many Latin sentences end met-

Utcumque erit,

rically, but this begins with four
feet ot a hexameter. operae: poss.
gen.; with pretium, “worth the
while.” ιι seiam: sciam in'a possi-
ble fut. condition, instead of the
more natural contrary to fact, as in
Cicero’s letterS, Fam. 8. 9. 1; 15. 1.
ausim: archaic for ausus eim.

2. quippe qm: either quippe. or
ut (cf. 4 below), often introduces a
causal relative clause in Livy. novi
semper scriptores: “new histor-
ians, constan'tly arising.’¹ scri·
bandi arte: “style ot composition,{’
contrasted with in rebus, “subject τ
matter.” ¹

8. memoriae: dat. with con-v
suluisse. It separates the rather
awkward group of genitiveS. pro
virili parte: “to the best of my
ability.” et ipsum: “myself as
well'' as the novi emptores,- et is
frequently so used with ipse in
Livy. pointing to other actions or
persons, officient: the indie. is

modestly kept.
