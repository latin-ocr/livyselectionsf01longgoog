This edition—parva sed apta it is hoped—has taken its
present form, as has the companion volume in this series

that should impose their less interesting chapters on
a student to the exclusion of other matterwhich may
*afford greater variety of interest and better illustrate
Livy's mastery of style and his versatility. In the
selections offered there has been an aim to preserve
the historian's method in well defined unitS‚ showing
regal and republican administration‚ the manner of life,
and especially through what sort of men the State

, extended its power as it expanded from a shepherd

settlement into a power dominant throughout Italy.
The brief notes are 111 keeping with a sane reaction
against the over-loaded- commentary, for American
editors in swinging away from the type of edition based
on this or that German work have sometimes proved
their own erudition at the expense of the student's real
needs. The student in his earlier stage, therefore, and

being to stimulate interest and to offer only such
· help as experience has shown to be practically necessary.
To this each teacher will add according to his particular

purpose. The great number of Latin grammars now
