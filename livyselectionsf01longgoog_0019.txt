INTRODUCTION 15

L. Calpurnius Piso, Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, Valerius
Antias, G. Licinius Macer, Q. Aelius Tuber0, and Cn.
Gellius. With the exception of Quadrigarius, who
began with the Gallio invasion of 390 B.C., each of these
writers began with the earliest period; Hemina con-
cluded his brief work of four books with the second
Punic war, while the others brought their work down
to contemporary events. None of these histories has
come down to uS, but ancient critics represent them
as varying much in style, and in the industry and trust-
worthiness of their authors Piso is used frequently by
Livy in books 1 and ΙΙ, but there could have been little
in common between the warmth of Livy's narrative
and the severe simplicity of Piso's style. While he is
mentioned by name six times, he is nowhere spoken
01 with any enthusiasm. To Quadrigarius and Antias»,
to Macer and Tuber0, Livy was likewise indebted ,101·
material in the first decade. Macer is expressly men-
tioned seven 13111168, but only in the first decade. The
author whom Livy quotes most frequently throughout
1118 work is Antias. His name appears thirty-six timeS,
often in slighting references after Livy reaches periods
where he is able to detect the apparently willful fabrica-
tions in which the work of Antias abounded. In many
instances these various authors are cited only to be
rejected, and for this reason we can not tell definitely
what source Livy follows when he has silently accepted
statements as facts,

These in the main were Livy's literary sources in the
first decade, though not all of these were used directly,
and none of them was used consistently throughout
any portion 01 1118 work. The extent to which he was
dependent upon a more or less fluid tradition 101· 13116

for any historian, has often rounded out the narrative,
