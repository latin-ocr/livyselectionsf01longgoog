IN TRODUCTION 17

or of a nation was in effect merely a story to be told.
This was still in the next century the conception of
so great an authority as Quintilian: Est (sc. historia)
proxima poetis et quodam modo car η solut'iimsset scribitur
ad narrandum, non ad probandum (10. 1. 31). The three
factors which entered most powerfully into the style of
such a production were formal training, the tendencies
of the period, and the individual temperament of the
writer. The formal rhetorical training of the Roman,
particularly after the full influence of Grecian culture,
is in evidence everywhere in their literature, and to
neglect it is to fail· to get the Roman point of view.

The justification for a new history, according to Livy
(Praef. 2), is to be found in the ability of the historiari
to contribute something more authentic in subject
matter, or at least to excel predecessors in style of com-
position. That his own work was not simply for the
reader’s entertainment is 'expressly stated (9. 17. 1).
The wholesome tone of his general Preface shows both
his integrity of purpose and his sound judgment as to
the poetic character of early traditions; and he adds,
haec et his similia, utcumque animadversa aut existimata
erunt, haud in maqno equidem ponam discrimine (Praef. 8).
Livy was far from indifferent as to whether his state-
ments were true, but where it was‘futile to attempt to'
sift the evidence he frankly recognizes the situation:
cura non deesset, si qua ad verum via inquirentem ferret
(7. 6. 6). Alleged history he more than once brands
as fabulae (1. 11. 8; 5. 21. 8); a myth is sometimes
rationalized (1. 8. 5). Where his sources were obviously
wrong, he attempts corrections (1. 18. 3 ; 1. 55. 8);
between two versions he may allow probability to deter-
mine his choice (21. 28. 6); or again where his sources
are at variance especially on points of great antiquity
he naively follows the majority—a method which at
